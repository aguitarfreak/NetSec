To compile (Windows/Linux)
 javac PacketDriverExample.java
To run example in Windows:
 java PacketDriverExample
To run example in Linux:
 java -Djava.library.path=. PacketDriverExample

Notes:
1.- This version should work both in 32 and 64 bit environments. SimplePacketDriver.class will try to load the 32-bit version first and if an error is reported, will load the 64-bit version instead.
2.- Make sure you are admin/root or you will not be able to open the adapter in promiscuous mode.

/doc - javadoc files documenting the driver
libsimplepacketdriver.so, libsimplepacketdriver_x64.so - Library with native hooks for Linux
simplepacketdriver.dll, simplepacketdriver_x64.dll - DLLs with native hooks for Windows
SimplePacketDriver.class - Open adapters, capture and send
SimplePacketDriver.jar - A jar with the previous class (so it's easier to import the class in some Java IDEs).

PacketDriverExample.class - Bytecode corresponding to previous file
packetdriverexample.pcap - Ethereal capturing traffic generated by sample program
